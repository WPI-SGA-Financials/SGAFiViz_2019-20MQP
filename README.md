## Database Admin Site

## Group Members: Andrew Morrison, Julian Pinzer, Peter Christakos, Katherine Thompson

Project Description:
Our project is a database admin page. This will allow users who own certain credentials the ability to add, delete, and modify entries within a MySQL database. Included in our site will be an intuitive and user-friendly design, and certain statistics shown on the dataset.

Plan
Use a Model-View-Controller pattern. Use a Javascript server as the controller that communicates with the MySQL database model. Ensure some scalability. We do not necessarily know if this will be used with larger datasets, but we want the site to be adaptive if it needed to. Research other websites for the most user-friendly design strategies. 
 
Purpose:
To give users a way to interact with the database without requiring programming skills. This creates more accessible data for the database owners.

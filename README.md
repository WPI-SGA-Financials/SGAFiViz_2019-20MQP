1. A brief description of what you created, and a link to the project itself.
2. Any additional instructions that might be needed to fully use your project (login information etc.)
3. An outline of the technologies you used and how you used them.
4. What challenges you faced in completing the project.
5. What each group member was responsible for designing / developing.
Think of 1,3, and 4 in particular in a similar vein to the design / tech achievements for A1—A4… make a case for why what you did was challenging and why your implementation deserves a grade of 100%.

## Admin DB Editor Wesbite

**By Peter Christakos, Andrew Morrison, Julian Pinzer, Katherine Thompson** 

For our project, we created a web application that connects to a MySQL server and provides an easy way for inexperienced database users to add, modify, and delete items from a database. Upon loading the website, you will be taken to the home screen which shows a graph constructed from data in a MySQL database. Click on the login tab to login and then you will be able to access the dashboard, which shows you the same graph along with a table below. You will be able to add, modify, and delete items from the glass and the table and graph will reload.

We used many technologies/features in the making of this project:
    1. React Framework
       1. React-router
       2. React-Redux
    2. Express server
       1. MySQL integration
       2. Login Functionality
       3. Add/Edit/Delete MySQL Data
    3. MySQL Server
    4. Bulma Design Pattern
    5. Tabulator
    6. Chartist for the graph
    7. Animating inputs and buttons based off of entries
    8. Clean design and layout

Since the majority of our group used React for the first time in the making of this project, the biggest challenge we faced was properly integrating all of our javascript code into the React framework.

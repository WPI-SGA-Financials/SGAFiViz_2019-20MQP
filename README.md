# Visualizing SGA's Financil Data and the Student Life Fee
Financial Data visualization website for SGA

 Worcester Polytechnic Institute provides students with the opportunity to get involved on campus with numerous clubs, organizations, and school sponsored events. Funding these endeavors is a large scale operation that the Student Government Association (SGA) is tasked with handling. The SGAâ€™s budget is comprised of the Student Life Fee, which is paid by each student. The student life fee, per student, was $280 in 2019, and $316 in 2020. The total Student Life Fee budget during the fiscal year of 2019 was approximately $1.2 million, and $1.4 million in 2020. SGA allocates this budget through the financial board to fund events, initiatives, and services for students. Unfortunately, many students are not aware of the purpose of this fee. Due to this, SGA has made financial transparency one of their overarching goals for this fiscal year. Our team has undertaken this goal. We have been tasked with bringing awareness to the student body about where their portion of the budget goes, and doing so in a visually stimulating manner.

# Visualizing SGA's Financial Data and the Student Life Fee

Worcester Polytechnic Institute provides students with the opportunity to get involved on campus with clubs, organizations, and school-sponsored events. Funding these endeavors is a large-scale operation that the Student Government Association (SGA) is tasked with handling. SGAâ€™s budget is comprised of the Student Life Fee, which is paid yearly by each student. Many students are not aware of the purpose of this fee, and due to this, SGA has made financial transparency one of their goals for this fiscal year. With this project, our team aims to use data visualization to bring awareness to the student body about where their portion of the student life fee goes. Students involved in SGA, club executives, students interested in their finances, and even future WPI students alike can all use our site in some way. This is just a start to bringing clarity to the student life fee, and we believe our project will provide a strong foundation to continue increasing transparency and spark important conversations about how students want their money allocated.
